### Welcome to my page âœ¨

polÂ·yÂ·math â€¢ /ËˆpÃ¤lÄ“ËŒmaTH/ â€¢ noun â€¢ a person of wide-ranging knowledge or learning.

I'm a jack-of-all-trades. I graduated with a B.S. in Data Science & Analytics and B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics in June 2020. Now, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Information Security & Assurance to compliment my full-time role as an IT Security Analyst. I also work as a part-time DevOps Engineer Intern which allows me to apply the skills I learned in order to obtain the AWS Developer Associate certification.
